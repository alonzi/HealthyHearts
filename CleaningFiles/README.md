These are the files that are used to clean the data

* Data Walkthrough.R - walks through labpanels, labvalues, and old echo data (PRODSOMRUNOS-InitialRun_DATA_LABELS_2020-10-13_0658.csv, DonorNet LabPanels.xlsx, and DonorNet LabValues.xlsx)
* Filtering LabPanels and LabValues by Donor.R - gets the data from labpanels and labvalues for the donors below the age of 30 and from whom a heart was recovered. Uses data from the tsv files deceased_donor_data.tsv, Donornet-Shared/Donornet-Shared/LabPanels.tsv.gz, and Donornet-Shared/Donornet-Shared/LabValues.tsv.gz. Converts them to DonorNet LabPanels.xlsx and DonorNet LabValues.xlsx
* LabPanels ranges.R - gets the range of each variable in the labpanels dataset from Donornet-Shared/Donornet-Shared/LabPanels.tsv.gz and puts them in a new sheet in the file donor_ranges.xlsx
* LabValues and LabPanels walkthrough.R - walks through the labvalues and labpanels data sets from the xlsx files DonorNet LabPanels.xlsx and DonorNet LabValues.xlsx, and, joining them with the crosswalk file STAR-shared/STAR-shared/cross-walk.csv, creates the files labpanels_crosswalk_joined.csv and labvalues_crosswalk_joined.csv
* LabValues ranges.R - gets the range of each variable in the labvalues dataset from Donornet-Shared/Donornet-Shared/LabValues.tsv.gz and puts them in a new sheet in the file donor_ranges.xlsx
* deceased_donor_data.R - takes in donor characteristics info from deceased_donor_data.tsv, cleans it, joins it with the crosswalk, and creates files deceased_donor_cleaned.csv and crosswalk_joined_deceased_donor.csv
* indicators_initial.R - gets data from INDICATORS.tsv, reads in STAR data from SAS Dataset-202009.zip, adds brain death and duration, and puts the variable ranges in a new sheet in the file donor_ranges.xlsx
* inotropic_initial.R - renames misspelled medications, reads in STAR data from SAS Dataset-202009.zip, adds in weight and brain death, changes units to desired units, and puts the variable ranges in a new sheet in the file donor_ranges.xlsx
